-- | The library application abstraction. Your application's operations
-- are provided in an @App@ and then the @App@ is provided to one of the
-- various main functions in this module. An application @App s e n@
-- is in terms of an application state type @s@, an application event
-- type @e@, and a resource name type @n@. In the simplest case 'e' is
-- unused (left polymorphic or set to @()@), but you may define your own
-- event type and use 'customMain' to provide custom events. The state
-- type @s@ is the type of application state to be provided by you and
-- iteratively modified by event handlers. The resource name type @n@
-- is the type of names you can assign to rendering resources such as
-- viewports and cursor locations. Your application must define this
-- type.
