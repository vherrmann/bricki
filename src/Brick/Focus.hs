-- | A focus ring containing a sequence of resource names to focus and a
-- currently-focused name.
newtype FocusRing n = FocusRing (C.CList n)

-- | Construct a focus ring from the list of resource names.
focusRing :: [n] -> FocusRing n
focusRing = FocusRing . C.fromList

-- | Advance focus to the next value in the ring.
focusNext :: FocusRing n -> FocusRing n
focusNext r@(FocusRing l)

-- | This function is a convenience function to look up a widget state
-- value's resource name in a focus ring and set its focus setting
-- according to the focus ring's state. This function determines whether
-- a given widget state value is the focus of the ring and passes the
-- resulting boolean to a rendering function, along with the state value
-- (a), to produce whatever comes next (b).
--
-- Focus-aware widgets have rendering functions that should be
-- usable with this combinator; see 'Brick.Widgets.List.List' and
-- 'Brick.Widgets.Edit.Edit'.

-- is emtpy, return 'Nothing'.
focusGetCurrent :: FocusRing n -> Maybe n

-- | Set the currently-focused resource name in the ring, provided the
-- name is in the ring. Otherwise return the ring unmodified.

-- | Get the size of the FocusRing.
focusRingLength :: FocusRing n -> Int
focusRingLength (FocusRing l) = C.size l

-- | Return all of the entries in the focus ring, starting with the
-- currently-focused entry and wrapping around the ring.
--
-- For example, if a ring contains A, B, C, and D, and the current entry
-- is B, the result will be [B, C, D, A].
focusRingToList :: FocusRing n -> [n]

-- | Modify the internal circular list structure of a focus ring
-- directly. This function permits modification of the circular list
-- using the rich Data.CircularList API.
